# High Availability Architecture
[Designing for High Availability in AWS](https://dzone.com/articles/designing-web-apps-for-high-availability-in-aws)

- Always design for failure
- Use multiple AZs and Regions whenever you can
- RDS - Multi-AZ and Read Replicas are different, only Multi-AZ is beneficial for HA
- Scaling out - using Auto-Scaling Groups
- Scaling up - increase resources of existing instances

Read carefully and consider the cost element of HA questions on the exams.

Know the different S3 storage classes.
