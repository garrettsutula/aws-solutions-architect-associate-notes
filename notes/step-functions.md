# AWS Step Functions
AWS Step Functions provides serverless orchestration for modern applications. Orchestration centrally manages a workflow by breaking it into multiple steps, adding flow logic, and tracking the inputs and outputs between the steps. As your applications execute, Step Functions maintains application state, tracking exactly which workflow step your application is in, and stores an event log of data that is passed between application components. That means that if networks fail or components hang, your application can pick up right where it left off.

Common Applications:
- Data processing: consolidate data from multiple databases into unified reports, refine and reduce large data sets into useful formats, or coordinate multi-step analytics and machine learning workflows
- DevOps and IT automation: build tools for continuous integration and continuous deployment, or create event-driven applications that automatically respond to changes in infrastructure
- E-commerce: automate mission-critical business processes, such as order fulfillment and inventory tracking
- Web applications: implement robust user registration processes and sign-on authentication
