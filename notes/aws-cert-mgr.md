# AWS Certificate Manager
To enable HTTPS connections to your website or application in AWS, you need an SSL/TLS server certificate. For certificates in a Region supported by AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), we recommend that you use ACM to provision, manage, and deploy your server certificates. In unsupported Regions, you must use IAM as a certificate manager.
